# 0x Examples

A collection of 0x API code examples

---

> ⚠️ **WARNING — READ BEFORE USING 0x API**
>
> - **NEVER** set an allowance on the [Settler contract](https://0x.org/docs/introduction/0x-cheat-sheet#0x-settler-contracts).  
>   Doing so may lead to **loss of tokens** or **security risks**.  
>   The Settler contract does **not** require allowances — setting one enables misuse by other parties.
>
> - **ONLY** set allowances on [Permit2](https://0x.org/docs/introduction/0x-cheat-sheet#permit2-contract) or [AllowanceHolder](https://0x.org/docs/introduction/0x-cheat-sheet#allowanceholder-contract) contracts, as indicated by the API response.
>
> - The correct allowance target is returned in `issues.allowance.spender`.

> - The examples in this repo are demos, and are not ready for production use. The code has not been audited and does not account for all error handling. Use at your own risk.
